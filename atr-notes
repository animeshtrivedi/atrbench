There are multiple modes
Throughput	Measures the number of operations per second, meaning the number of times per second your benchmark method could be executed.
Average Time	Measures the average time it takes for the benchmark method to execute (a single execution).
Sample Time	Measures how long time it takes for the benchmark method to execute, including max, min time etc.
Single Shot Time	Measures how long time a single benchmark method execution takes to run. This is good to test how it performs under a cold start (no JVM warm up).
All	Measures all of the above.


Q: how to find which benchmark to run?
see -h with the help you can pass regex string

Q: Reduce number of iteration and warmup?
see -h with -wi and -i and -f flags

Example :
java -jar ./target/atrbench-uber.jar copyMethod -wi 0 -f 1 -i 3 -bm avgt -prof stack

It also has a profiler to see which functions took the time.

In order to use the profiler, one needs to

# echo -1 >  /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

Documentation:
  -1: Allow use of (almost) all events by all users
>= 0: Disallow raw tracepoint access by users without CAP_IOC_LOCK
>= 1: Disallow CPU event access by users without CAP_SYS_ADMIN
>= 2: Disallow kernel profiling by users without CAP_SYS_ADMIN

Q: Where is the generated souce code?
The generated code target/generated-sources/annotations/.../

Q: Can we mark the class which has the benchmark function?
A: Yes, we can :
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/a128fd4a5901/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_04_DefaultState.java
@State(Scope.Thread)
public class Your_CLASS {

Q: Between benchmark mode defined in the code as ""@Benchmark   @BenchmarkMode(Mode.AverageTime)" and what we can
pass on the shell as -bm? which takes effect?
A: -bm takes precedence

Q: How to run for various values
A: See @Param thing.

Q: What are the benchmarks I would like to have?
- System.arraycopy
- ByteBuffer get and put
- ByteBuffer aligned and un-aligned
- Kryo speeds with different data types
- Parquet read and write performance
- byte[] allocate rate
